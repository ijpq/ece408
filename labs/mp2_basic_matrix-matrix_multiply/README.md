# Objective

The purpose of this lab is to implement a basic dense matrix multiplication routine.

# Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, make sure that:
- You have completed the “Vector Addition” MP
- You have completed all week 2 lecture videos

# Instruction

Edit the code in the ‘Code’ tab to perform the following:
- allocate device memory
- copy host memory to device
- initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions
- invoke CUDA kernel
- copy results from device to host
- deallocate device memory
